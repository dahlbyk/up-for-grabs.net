       This is a list of projects which have curated tasks
       specifically for new contributors. These are a great
       way to get started with a project, or to help share
       the load of working on open source projects.
     </p>

     <p>
       Find a project you'd like to get involved with:

       <ul>
        <li>read the contributor guidelines for the project</li>
        <li>get the project running locally</li>
        <li>leave a message on a task you'd like to work on</li>
        <li>get to work!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="block">

    <div id="projects-panel">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <h1><span class="header-inside">I maintain a project!</span></h1>

    <p>
      We're looking for projects who can take the time out to
      help mentor developers as they get started with
      open source.
    </p>

    <p>
      What sort of tasks are a good fit?

      <ul>
        <li>Tasks should take no longer than a few nights' worth of work</li>
        <li>Tasks should stand alone - avoid core functionality on which other tasks depend</li>
        <li>Tasks should be well described with pointers to help the implementer</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We suggest the tag <code>up-for-grabs</code>
      but using a different name is also acceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this sounds like you, getting involved is simple:

      <ol>
       <li>Tag bugs and feature requests that would be a good place to start</li>
       <li>Grab the URL to this list of tasks so that others can get to it easily</li>
       <li><a href="https://github.com/login">Sign in to GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net#add-your-project">check out the README.</a></li>

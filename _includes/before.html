<h3>I want to get involved!</h3>

<p>
 This is a list of projects which have curated tasks
 specifically for new contributors. These are a great
 way to get started with a project, or to help share
 the load of working on open source projects.
</p>

<p>
 Find a project you'd like to get involved with:

  <ul>
    <li>read the contributor guidelines for the project</li>
    <li>get the project running locally</li>
    <li>leave a message on a task you'd like to work on</li>
    <li>get to work!</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>I maintain a project and want to participate!</h3>

<p>
  We're looking for projects who can take the time out to
  help mentor developers as they get started with
  open source.
</p>

<p>
  What sort of tasks are a good fit?

<ul>
  <li>Tasks should take no longer than a few nights' worth of work</li>
  <li>Tasks should stand alone - avoid core functionality on which other tasks depend</li>
  <li>Tasks should be well described with pointers to help the implementer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  We suggest the tag <code>up-for-grabs</code>
  but using a different name is also acceptable.
</p>

<p>
  If this sounds like you, getting involved is simple:

<ol>
 <li>Tag bugs and feature requests that would be a good place to start</li>
 <li>Grab the URL to this list of tasks so that others can get to it easily</li>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/login">Sign in to GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/up-for-grabs.net#add-your-project">check out the README.</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
